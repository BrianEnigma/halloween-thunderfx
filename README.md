#Interactive Halloween Thunder Effects

![Lightning](http://netninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/halloween-thunderfx.gif "Lightning")

This project covers the hardware and software for a Halloween effects system I recently built for a haunted house. When idle, it's a simple programmable ambient light system that cycles between spooky colors. But! There is a hidden foot switch that activates a flash of lightning and the boom of thunder. A well timed tap of the switch can activate an astounding surprise.

The hardware is mostly based on parts I had laying around, but I've provided equivalent links to Adafruit. The main components are:

- An Arduino with Wave Shield to provide the brains and sound
- A programmable LED strip
- Buttons (for adjusting the lighting as well as the foot switch)
