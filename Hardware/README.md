#Halloween Thunder Effects

#Bill of Materials

I used the following (or equivalents I already had laying around) to build this project. Where possible, I linked to the Adafruit product pages.

- [Arduino](https://www.adafruit.com/products/50)
- [Wave Shield for Arduino](https://www.adafruit.com/products/94)
- 4m [NeoPixel strip, black, 30 LEDs/m](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1460)
- Four buttons, some were small ones I had on hand, others were [arcade buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/products/475)
- [Foot switch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/423)
- [5V 10A power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/products/658) -- the NeoPixel strip eats up a lot of power!
- Two project enclosures. I think I got these from Radio Shack long, long ago.
- [Terminal blocks](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?x=0&y=0&lang=en&site=us&KeyWords=CBB202-ND) and mounting screws
- Spool of at least 3 conductor wire (to separate the button box from the control box). I used telephone wire.

Plus assorted commodity parts:

- Zip ties, used as strain reliefs as well as for mounting
- M3 [Screws](http://www.mcmaster.com/#91290A120), [nuts](http://www.mcmaster.com/#98676A100), and [nylon standoffs](http://www.mcmaster.com/#93657A143) for mounting the Arduino in its box
- Soldering iron, solder, wire, etc.

Plus the required audio gear:

- 1/8" male to 1/8" male headphone cable
- A stereo or powered speakers
